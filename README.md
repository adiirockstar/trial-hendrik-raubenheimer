# Hendrik Raubenheimer's Codex

## Design Choices

I opted for a RAG approach that uses PDFs as training data. The PDF format was chosen for its prevalence and common usage.
I chose Gemini as my LLM of choice because of my familiarity with it. From experience I know its very easy to set up with conversation memory and has a generous free tier. In this project I was able to create a client that can facilitate conversations with memory in only 2 lines of code.
I opted for Streamlit as my UI platform of choice. Streamlit has a reputation for being an easy and quick way of deploying a chatbot or dashboard. I can confirm I quickly came right with Streamlit as someone with no prior experience with it.

## Sample Questions and Answers

Question: What kind of engineer are you?
Answer: Right, so, if you're asking what kind of engineer I am, I'd put myself squarely in the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence. My qualifications have given me a solid footing across computer science, data science, and of course, the mathematical side of things. Honestly, I live and breathe code, constantly looking for new ways to apply it, especially when it comes to solving real-world problems with data and AI.

Question: What are your strongest technical skills?
Answer: Right, my strongest technical skills. I'd definitely highlight Java and Python as my core programming languages; I've got years of hands-on experience with both, using Java for more foundational work and Python being my go-to for anything related to data science and AI.
Beyond that, I'm very strong with SQL for database management and querying, and I'm quite proficient with Pandas for data manipulation within Python. When it comes to the AI side, I've got solid experience with TensorFlow for machine learning models, and I'm familiar with AWS for cloud deployments.
It's a blend of robust development skills and the specific tools that are essential for data and AI work.

Question: What are you most afraid of?
Answer: Honestly, if I had to hit the nail on the head with that one, I'd say my greatest apprehension would be intellectual stagnation. In a field like Machine Learning and AI, things move at an incredible pace, and the thought of not being able to constantly live and learn, to keep pushing myself, or to see my skills become less relevant... that's a genuine concern.
I thrive on challenges, on diving deep into complex problems, and on building things that make a tangible difference. The idea of not being able to contribute meaningfully, or to feel like my passion isn't being applied to create a positive snowball effect in the real world â€“ that's something I actively work against. I want to be where the problems are, where I can apply my grit and ambition, and ensure that fortune favours the bold in our pursuit of innovative solutions.
